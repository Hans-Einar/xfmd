pursues, supports and contributes-to; modeled scope without an invented System boundary.

## Scope and notation

Complete declared actor/use-case inventory in this source snapshot, including isolated declarations. An association means SDL pursues; no System boundary or UML include/extend is inferred.

## Functionality realization

Features and Functionality are not use cases. Only modeled supports and contributes-to relations are listed.

| Source | Relation | Target | Fact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Display | contributes-to | Navigation | f0001 |
| Navigation | supports | Browse | f0002 |

Scenario sequences and pre/postconditions are not part of this overview; they are not inferred from static relations.


Model gap NO_CONTRIBUTION: No direct or Feature-mediated Functionality contributions. (Export; mode=).

Model gap NO_ACTOR: No Actor pursues this use case. (Isolated; mode=).

Model gap NO_CONTRIBUTION: No direct or Feature-mediated Functionality contributions. (Isolated; mode=).

Model gap NO_GOAL: Actor has no pursues relation. (Guest; mode=).
